  This example shows:
   - Specific version of the isopod.
   - this is for go application
   - custom quality checks
usage:
  version: 2.1

  orbs:
    go: circleci/go@1.7.1
    ric-orb: ricardo/ric-orb@2

  #FIXME: isopod version that you want to use
  cfg-isopod-version: &cfg-isopod-version
    isopod_version: 0.29.4
  #FIXME: go executor version to be used (from circleci's go-orb)
  cfg-go-build-test-executor: &cfg-go-build-test-executor

  #FIXME: change with working dirs of your apps

  #FIXME: name of the job that github check is looking for

    common:

      default: false

  #below there are two workflows, api uses 5 jobs and worker uses 7 jobs to get same thing done
  #the difference comes from the fact that api uses same docker image for master branch and other branches
  #while worker builds one image for branch, and one for master, only difference is context.
  #If you need different context for any reason use worker's approach
