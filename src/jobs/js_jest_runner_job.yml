# Execution

steps:
  - checkout
  - attach_workspace:
      at: .
  - run:
      name: Running tests
      # equally spread tests with a given split_by strategy
      command: |
        shopt -s globstar # This is to make sure that ** is understood as pattern when globbing, e.g. /src/**/*.test.ts
        circleci tests glob << parameters.globPattern >> | circleci tests split --split-by=<< parameters.split_by >> > testing/tmp-test-list
        yarn << parameters.script >>

  # storing test results is needed for circleci to compare them between runs and choose the best split
  # in circleci UI it results with TESTS tab being filled with results
  # for debugging use circleci's store_artifacts command, in circleci UI you will see the content of xml file
  - store_test_results:
      path: ./reports/junit

# Parameters

parameters:
  resource_class:
    type: string
    default: medium+
  script:
    type: string
  # define which files should be included for testing
  globPattern:
    type: string
  # how many nodes will run in parallel
  parallelism:
    type: integer
    default: 4
