# Exclude all low-severity security alerts.
- exclude:
    security-severity: /^[0-6]\./   # security-severity < 7.

# Exclude all Warnings and Notes (keep in mind that the following directive will exclude all alerts carrying Warning or Note designation;
#   this could cause certain important alerts to get excluded if they are designated as high-severity security alerts at the same time).
- exclude:
    problem.severity:
      - recommendation
      - warning

# Re-include all high-severity security alerts (since alerts can at the same time be both security alerts (having designated security-severity) and Warnings/Notes/Errors).
- include:
    security-severity: /^([7-9]|10)\./   # security-severity >= 7.

# Re-include Error alerts (those that have been excluded earlier due to low-severity filter).
# Remark: CodeQL alerts define Error as an issue that is likely to cause incorrect program behavior, for example a crash or vulnerability.
#         Alert may be designated as Error and have low-severity security score, but it will show up in the final code scanning report due
#         to the following inclusion directive (that's why you may find e.g. medium-severity alert in the report).
- include:
    problem.severity: error
